promise javascript

promises three states are there -->
--> pending : initial state , neither fulfilled nor rejected.
--> fulfilled : meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
--> rejected : meaning that the operation failed .

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

Are there stile reasons to use promise libraries like Q or BlueBird now that we have ES6 promises?[closed]

Fetch ()
you made a request through promise and from there you got an error , so they fetch you , will you get it , meaning will you get it in resolve or reject ??
Ans :
You will always get a response , it is not an error , the error will happen only when the request is not able to be done by the bowser , it is only howthat you get an error


The Fetch API uses Request and Response objects (and other things involved with network requests), as well as related concepts such as CORS and the HTTP Origin header semantics.

Fetch Method
https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-method follow notes for fetch method

response = fetch ('somthing')
fetch devide by two part
==> web bowser / node
==> some of your variables and to reserve the complete space for data in the memories
    ==> onfulfilled[func] this is the promise resolution
    ==> onrejection[func] this is the rejection
    These are there you are not allowed to push values directly in these arrays . These are not you range you can't access them , these are privet fields even the data is a privet field .

    this func are responsible for filling the data
