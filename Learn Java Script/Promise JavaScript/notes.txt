promise javascript

promises three states are there -->
--> pending : initial state , neither fulfilled nor rejected.
--> fulfilled : meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
--> rejected : meaning that the operation failed .

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
